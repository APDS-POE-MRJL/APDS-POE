This is the repository for APDS POE Part 2, group MRJL will develop and publish changes to the application here

The students who developed this application are

Matthew Stewart - ST10044670
Ryan Berriman - ST10044691
Jordan Reddy - ST10047883
Luke Berriman - ST10044660

This application contains both the backend (which contains the API used for user authentication) and the frontend (Which contains the website)

When using the application, ensure you run the backend first, it's been tested and functions inside of VSCode

Once the backend is active, you can then boot up the frontend, which will launch a webpage using an open port

Once the website has opened, you are able to create an account (using register) and login with an account (using login)

Once you have logged in with a valid account, you will be redirected back to the home page, you are then able to sign out at any time

The service has been built and works on both windows 10 and 11 systems, the website is lightweight and is exptected to work on all web browsers with no issues

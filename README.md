# Usage

To run the appliation, you first need to open the folder in VS Code, you will then need to have 2 terminlas (1 for backend, 1 for frontend) 
to access the files to run the projects you will do 'cd backend' followed by 'npm start' to boot up the backend API
to access the webstie, you will do 'cd frontend' followed by 'npm start' to boot up the website (if either of the npm starts show errors, make sure to run 'npm install')

Once the website is active, you can then register or login with a new user account, which will then have the capabilities to submit new transaction requests to the API which will store the information, 
Administrators are also able to sign in using the same login terminal, however they are are then able to view your transaction details and either accept or reject transaction requests sent by users
